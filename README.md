# java-flow-experiments
Experimenting with [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org), which are going to become part of the Java 9 in the java.util.concurrent.flow package.

In this repository I'm playing with two implementations of Reactive Streams:
- [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) (it's going to be included in Spring 5)
- [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
