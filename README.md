# java-flow-experiments
In this repository, I'm experimenting with [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org), which are going to become part of the Java 9 in the `java.util.concurrent` package in Java 8 application and with [native Java 9 Reactive Streams](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) as well.

This repository was prepared for my talk titled **Get ready for java.util.concurrent.Flow!** 

during [JDD](http://jdd.org.pl) 2017 Conference in Krak√≥w, Poland.

Java 8 project
--------------

Inside `java8` directory, I'm playing with two implementations of Reactive Streams:
- [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) (it's going to be included in Spring 5)
- [Akka Stream](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/master/akka-stream)

Projects inside `java8` directory can be cleaned, compiled and run via Gradle Wrapper.

Java 9 project
--------------

Inside `java9` directory I'm playing with native Java 9 Reactive Streams interfaces.
In this setup, you need to have installed Java 9 from Oracle in the following path: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-oracle/` (it was tested under Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS). Please use `java9/builder.sh` script to clean, compile and run the application. Call `./builder.sh -h` for help. To clean, build and run project call `./builder.sh -cbr`. You can also import this project in IntelliJ IDEA and do the same through IntelliJ IDEA. I haven't used Gradle in this project, because it's not compatible with Java 9 yet.
